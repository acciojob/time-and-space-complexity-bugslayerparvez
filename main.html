	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of how the runtime of an algorithm changes with the size of the input. Understanding time complexity helps developers design more <em>efficient</em> programs by analyzing how quickly algorithms perform under different conditions.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to its input size. For example, an algorithm that uses linear memory with respect to input size has a space complexity of O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input data.
